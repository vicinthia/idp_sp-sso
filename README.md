## 👤 My Contribution
I worked on all parts of this application myself, including :
- UI design and creation using Flutter.
- Backend implementation using PHP Rest API and MySQL.
- Create a standard Json Web Token authentication system with Internal SSO method (without involving third parties such as Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Application testing and debugging.
